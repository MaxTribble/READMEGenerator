  ## Description
  I was tired of creating every challenge readme by hand, from scratch. I thought surely, with the new knowledge I've gained, I could make a program that makes one easily. This could be helpful for anyone who was going through the same struggles I was. The biggest takeaway from the project, I learned how to collect data, and run it through another file to create a page.

  ## Installation
  Open this code in your own VS code window and get to generating!

  ## Usage
  Once you have the program open in you VS code window, open the terminal. From there, type node index, hit enter and follow the prompts given. Once you're done, a readme page will be generated into the files.
